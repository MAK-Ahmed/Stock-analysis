# Stock-analysis

# Overview of the project
The purpose of this was to review the stock data for 2017 and provide an automated script that will run the data upon command by the user. This challenge utilized the VBA funciton in excel to run the data for the year 2017 and 2018. the purpose of the assignment was to refractor a code that was already provided and apply this to the new dataset.

## Results

Running a refractured code utilizing the VBA yealed faster results thn running this initially on its own. as a result of refracturing the code, it decreased the run time and optimized functionality. The stock performance did very similar between the two years. Only two tickers in both years were successful and positive.
The year for 2017 took longer to run then the one for 2018. below are the rates at which the analysis ran

## Summary
### Advantages or disadvantages
* Advantages to refactoring code are that some pieces of code that minimally change, do not need to be edited. 
* Disadvantages include being able to follow along with the code and understand what is requested. In some places, the code is not clear, thus requiring further analysis
* Dhe original script was utilized to review why pieces of code were not working.
